<h2>The Big Bad Wolf</h2>
  <p>
    You never see him on a clear day light<br>
just a sharp silhouette on a sleepless night<br>
feel his breath on your neck<br>
you turn around but what the heck!?
  </p>
  <p>
  You smell his scent in the air<br>
although you know - no one is there<br>
so why do you keep feeling that he's <br>
following you everywhere
   </p>
<p>
You had the most perfect night<br>
with champagne and candlelight<br>
wanted to meet him on saturday<br>
but he had some other plans made<br>
he said he was out of town<br>
so howcome you saw him driving around<br>
in his Bel Air cool and neat<br>
with that witch on the front seat
  </p>
<p>
Went to the street<br>
BOP-BA-DAP-BA-BA-DABA-DAB-BOP<br>
with a gun<br>
BOP-BA-DAP-BA-BA-DABA-DAB-BOP<br>
I decided now he's done<br>
I'm gonna make you RUN!
  </p>
<p>
BOP-BA-DAP-BA-BA-DABA-DAB-BOP...(until eternity)
I shot The Big Bad Wolf!
